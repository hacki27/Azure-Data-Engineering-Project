# Azure Data Engineering Project

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end data engineering solution using Azure services for data ingestion, transformation, loading, and reporting.

## Technologies Used
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Azure Databricks
- Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse)
- Microsoft Power BI
- Azure Active Directory (AAD)
- Azure Key Vault

## Project Structure
The project is structured into several components:
- **Data Ingestion**: Using Azure Data Factory to ingest data from on-premise SQL Server into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- **Data Transformation**: Utilizing Azure Databricks for data cleaning and transformation.
- **Data Loading**: Loading transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics for structured querying.
- **Reporting**: Creating interactive dashboards and reports using Microsoft Power BI integrated with Azure Synapse Analytics.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Azure account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.
- Access to Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, Microsoft Power BI, Azure Active Directory, and Azure Key Vault.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Follow the setup instructions in each component directory (`data_ingestion/`, `data_transformation/`, `data_loading/`, `reporting/`) to configure and deploy Azure resources.
